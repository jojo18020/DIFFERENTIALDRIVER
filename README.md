# DIFFERENTIALDRIVER
Modular MATLABâ€“ROS2 project for a differential-drive robot. Generates smooth spline paths from 2D waypoints, creates time-parameterized trajectories, and tracks them using a feedback controller. Includes ROS2 integration, visualizations, and can be extended for real-time obstacle avoidance.
