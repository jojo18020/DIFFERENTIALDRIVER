# DIFFERENTIALDRIVER
Modular MATLAB‚ÄìROS2 project for a differential-drive robot. Generates smooth spline paths from 2D waypoints, creates time-parameterized trajectories, and tracks them using a feedback controller. Includes ROS2 integration, visualizations, and can be extended for real-time obstacle avoidance.
Differential Drive Trajectory Tracking ‚Äì MATLAB + ROS2

This project implements path smoothing, trajectory generation, and feedback control for a TurtleBot3 differential-drive robot in MATLAB with ROS2 integration.
It converts discrete 2D waypoints into smooth trajectories and makes the robot follow them in simulation.

Setup Instructions

Clone or download this repository.

Open MATLAB and add all files to your MATLAB path (Add Folder and Subfolders).

Ensure ROS2 (Humble) is installed and accessible from WSL.

Launch the TurtleBot3 simulation and connect MATLAB to the same ROS domain.

Example Workflow
Terminal 1 (WSL)
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=123
unset ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
ros2 launch turtlebot3_fake_node turtlebot3_fake_node.launch.py

In MATLAB (Command Window)
setenv('ROS_DOMAIN_ID','123');
main_ros_*


Each main_ros_* file represents a different path:

main_ros_square.m ‚Üí square path

main_ros_crcl.m ‚Üí circular path

main_ros_sqiggly.m ‚Üí curved ‚Äúsquiggly‚Äù path

main_ros_J.m ‚Üí J-shaped path

üìà Results (What You‚Äôll See)

Smooth trajectory tracking across custom waypoints

Continuous velocities at waypoint boundaries

Real-time plots of position, curvature, and wheel speeds

Animated visualization of TurtleBot3 motion

Extensibility

The modular design allows simple extensions:

Add obstacle avoidance (e.g., potential fields or DWA)

Replace controller or velocity profiles independently

Deploy on a real TurtleBot3 with minimal changes
